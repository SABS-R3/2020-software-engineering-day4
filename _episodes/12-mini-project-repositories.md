## Thinking About Mini-Projects

This afternoon we don't have any content to cover, so we've set this time aside for a first look at the mini-projects for next week.

For an intro to the topic and objectives, see [this link](https://sabs-r3.github.io/2020-software-engineering-projects/01-introduction/index.html).

A [template repository](https://github.com/sabs-r3/2020-software-engineering-projects-pk) has been prepared, which you may wish to use as a starting point.
This repository contains some of the core functionality and infrastructure which you will find useful for the project.
Note that some of the infrastructure belongs to topics we haven't covered yet, such as testing.

In your project groups, read through the project introduction and investigate the template repository.
Between you, do you understand all of the components of the existing code?

If you have time, you may wish to start thinking about plans for your collaborative work on this project.
